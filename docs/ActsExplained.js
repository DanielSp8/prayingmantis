  "The ACTS prayer model is an acronym that can be useful for prayer.  It begins here:  with Adoration.  While praying, it's important to keep one's mind focused upon who God is.  No matter what has happened, what we've done or haven't done, it's vital to keep oneself engaged in adoring God for who He is.",
  "Not only is adoration important in moments of prayer, but it is also very important to spend time in confession.  It's not merely about navel-gazing, looking for something wrong we've done.  But facing the hard truth of ways we've neglected to obey the Lord is important.  Confessing our sin involves admitting we were wrong, but it ought to also involve repenting and turning away from our sin.  Repentance is the great gift whereby we get right with God and friendship, intimacy and fellowship with Him are restored.",
  "After sinking down into a time of getting real with yourself and God, confessing and turning away from sin; it's now time to rise upon the wings of thanksgiving.  Giving thanks to God embodies what it means to be a Christian.  Neglecting it leads to a ditch of complaining, eventually into a gross pit of despair and hopelessness.  However, giving thanks is a way of entering into God's very best and it will also fuel your soul with joy and peace.  Rejoice!  Give thanks!",
  "In this ACTS prayer model, it's likely that supplication is here at the end of this prayer model because asking God for things tends to be something we often want to naturally do first.  It's not wrong to ask God for things!  However, this prayer model of ACTS helps to keep things in perspective and order.  It's much easier to pray larger prayers when we've taken time to look upon the majesty of God through adoration.  Apart from time in confessing and repenting of our sin, we cannot be right with Him!  And thanksgiving--in a way--sets the temperature higher for agreeing with God and what He desires to do in the lives of others and our own lives as well.",
