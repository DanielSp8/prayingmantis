# Praying Mantis
## This is a mobile app created with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React-Native, NodeJS).
### This is an app I created to help people pray.

## Included Features:
### This mobile app has a login feature, which uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) in order to verify the user.
### It uses MongoDB to store information for the user, including a username, password and personal prayer requests.
### Users are able to create personal prayer requests, which have prayer lists and a specific prayer theme.

## I also created a screen which displays the A.C.T.S. prayer acronym, which stands for:
### Adoration
### Confession
### Thanksgiving
### Supplication
### This is a prayer method I included on this app, in order to help people stay focused in the place of prayer.

## Identity in Christ:
### I also included a component, which displays different affirmations and verses based upon a believer's identity in Christ.
### It uses hand gestures to flip through virtual index cards.

## Daily Unreached People Group
### I uses the Joshua Project API for this.
### It displays an unreached people group of the day,
### which has an image of a person in the people group, along with information about the specific people group.
